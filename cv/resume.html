			<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		</td><td>
			<h3>03/2014 - Present — Software Engineer, Eclipse Team, <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat UK Ltd</a></h3>
			<p>As an engineer on the Eclipse Team at Red Hat, my main responsibilities include maintaining the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Platform</a> and our Eclipse-based products in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and upstream in our community distribution, Fedora Linux. My duties also include contributing improvements to the Eclipse Linux Tools project, the Eclipse Platform project and any other projects that may be necessary in order to keep Eclipse building and working as well on Linux as it does on the other major platforms.</p>
			<h3>03/2011 - 03/2014 — Senior Software Engineer, <a href="http://www.wandisco.com/">WANdisco Inc</a></h3>
			<p>Being one of the main sponsors of the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a> project my main responsibilities at WANdisco have been to design and develop aspects of their enterprise and business ecosystem of Subversion-based products. In particular I have been involved in the major redevelopment of the company's flag-ship product <a href="http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/multisiteplus">SVN MultiSite Plus</a>, which gives customers with large sets of distributed engineers the ability to have geographically local replicas of Subversion source code repositories with multi-master (as opposed to master-slave or fail-over) replication of commits. Working on these products has given me a much deeper understanding of distributed computing than I had previously.</p>
			<p>I was also heavily involved in the development of <a href="http://www.wandisco.com/ubersvn/download">a separate product</a>
 designed for the management of single node installations of Subversion.
 With the help of others I am currently in the process of getting this 
product released as an open source project.</p>
			<h3>12/2006 - 03/2011 — Software Engineer, <a href="http://www.servelec-technologies.com/">CSE-Servelec Ltd</a></h3>
			<p>Quickly gained promotion from Junior Software Engineer to Software Engineer.</p>
			<p>The primary project I was involved in was the design and implementation of a centralised meteorological monitoring system for the UK Met Office. This involved working with a partner outstation supplier to provide automatic, fault-tolerant telemetry data collection services over IP, PSTN and GSM networks for climate science and flight-safety purposes.</p>
			<p>With the help of UK Met Office scientists, we developed algorithms that augment the raw telemetry collected using past and present data collected from various sensors to improve the accuracy of the detection of meteorological events. I was also responsible for the implementation of the World Meteorological Organisation's standards on data exchange, which allows the UK Met Office to share data from this system with meteorological agencies around the world.</p>
			<p>In addition to project work for external customers, I've also worked on instituting new internal build and issue tracking systems. This included migrating source code from disparate version control systems to a single Apache Subversion repository and replacing an ageing, in-house issue tracking system with an open source <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">issue tracker</a> and <a href="http://bitten.edgewall.org/">build system</a> in order to reduce maintenance overhead, simplify processes and provide continuous integration testing. A part of this work has been to write plug-ins and patches in Python to customise these systems to match (and in some cases, improve) our internal business processes.</p>
			<h3>08/2004 - 11/2006 — Various Posts, <a href="http://www.adecco.co.uk/">Adecco</a></h3>
			<p>Prior to finding a job in the software industry, I took work where I could through a temping agency. This included a variety of data entry, office clerk and warehouse positions.</p>

			<h2>Other Experience</h2>

			<h3>12/2007 - Present — Package Maintainer, <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora">The Fedora Project</a></h3>
			<p>As an enthusiastic participant in the open source community, I serve as the primary maintainer for <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/users/packages/mbooth">many Java and Eclipse related packages</a>
 for Fedora Linux and have earned "proven packager" status for my work, 
which includes the maintenance of several Eclipse plug-ins and several 
key low-level Java libraries that are used by hundreds of other 
libraries and applications. The continuing goal is to make Fedora the 
best Linux distribution for Java and Eclipse based software development,
 both as an IDE and as a platform.</p>
			<p>Package maintenance duties include responding to user bug reports 
and either reporting them to the upstream project or submitting patches 
upstream as appropriate, keeping packages up to date as new versions are
 released and working with other maintainers from around the world to 
ensure all dependencies and dependent packages continue to interact with
 each other correctly.</p>
			<h3>Present — Committer and Contributor, Various Open Source Projects</h3>
			<p>Working with someone from the open source Java and Eclipse 
communities in the Fedora Project, I have been involved in the 
development of a popular <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/shelled/">Shell Script</a> editor plug-in for Eclipse.</p>
			<p>I am a committer and project management committee (PMC) member of the <a href="http://bloodhound.apache.org/">Apache Bloodhound</a> project. I am a committer on the Linux Tools project of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>
			<p>I have contributed patches to various other projects including other Eclipse projects, OpenLDAP, Apache Maven, Spring Security and others.</p>
