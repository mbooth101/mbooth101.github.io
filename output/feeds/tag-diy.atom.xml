In this post I document the manufacture of a new handle from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starting from Scrap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this piece of hardwood offcut in my scrap drawer for a while and thought it would be ideal for this project. Unfortunately I'm not a woodologist so I can't tell you what species this is but the grain is much finer and straighter than the original handle. Let's assume that's a good thing for this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="One Man's Rubbish..." src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-1-table-saw-blank_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut out a handle blank that is a bit larger in all dimensions than the original handle using the table saw, then with a hand saw I cut a tenon in one end so that it was a snug fit into the hammer head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Not a Shark" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-2-hammer-head-tenon_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Taking Shape&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp corners are no good for a handle, so the next job was to take a hand file and start adding some contours. I used the file to bring the shoulders of the tenon in to where the wood meets the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Those Curves!" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-3-hand-filed-shoulder_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That nice straight grain meant that as soon as I added some curves, pretty patterns immediately appeared. Below is a shot of the whole thing after sanding some ergonomics into the rest of the handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hit Stuff in Comfort" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-4-shaped-handle_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two metal wedges you can see in the bottom right of the above picture are the wedges that were retaining the old handle in the head of the hammer. In the end I decided not to re-use these and instead made a wooden wedge from the same stock as the new handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After giving it some sanding with slightly higher grit I gave it a couple coats of a hard-wearing poly-urethane varnish. This is a tool I expect to use often, so I want it to be able to resist some punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hit Stuff in Style" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-5-varnish-leather_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see I also drilled a hole in the end of the handle and tied on a loop of scrap leather. I've no idea yet if I will find this feature useful. Maybe it'll be handy to be able to hang it somewhere when I'm up a ladder. Maybe I'll just swing it around like Thor...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step is to permanently affix the head onto the handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="And Only for a Minute" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-6-wedge-just-the-tip_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a one-saw-kerf-width slot in the tenon and fashioned a crude wedge on the belt sander from a slice of the same stock as I used for the handle. Once I was ready to commit, I applied some PVA and hammered the wedge home. After letting the glue dry I was able to trim off the excess with a hand saw and sand it flush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Feeling Flush" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-7-wedge-trimmed-flush_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the finished article side-by-side with the old handle. I'm pretty happy with it. Table saw scale for, er, scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bonus Nine Month Update!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I managed to procrastinate writing this post for more than half a year, and I've used this hammer most weekends since January (it is September now) for various projects, including ripping out my bathroom (I will likely talk about that in a future post) I can tell you how well my repair went!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has put up with a fair amount of abuse and there are plenty of dings and dents in the finish to show for it, but there is no actual damage to the handle, which is good. I'm pleased with the shape and the extra length in the handle too as compared to the original; it's quite comfortable to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that did happen however is that after a few weeks of really beating on a cold chisel to remove some tiling and plaster work, the head was starting to work its way loose. Not because the wedge was becoming unstuck though, it seems like the wood fibres in the tenon had just compressed a bit after some amount of bedding in. I disassembled the hammer by drilling out the original wedge and reinforced it by cutting two more saw-kerfs into the tenon and making three new wooden wedges. Here it is after the glue has set and the wedges sawn flush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It's Called &amp;quot;Character&amp;quot;" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/11-9-update-wedges_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been completely solid ever since. Sure, it's a bit uglier now because the end of the tenon sits a little bit below the top of the hammer head preventing sanding, but who cares; it's a tool for using not for looking at. And that loop of leather at the end of the handle? Ultimately pointless, I do just swing it about like Thor after all...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category><category term="diy"></category></entry><entry><title>Don't Know My Own Strength</title><link href="https://matbooth.co.uk/07-broken-tools.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-01-29T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-03T12:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Mat Booth</name></author><id>tag:matbooth.co.uk,2019-01-29:/07-broken-tools.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Breaking cheap tools so you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like to subscribe to Adam Savage's philosophy on buying tools, which goes something along the lines of, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/maker/comments/4hv3an/maker_ama_series_i_am_adam_savage_maker/d2slfgb/"&gt;"buy cheap tools until you know know what you really need from them, then buy the best version you can afford."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind I tend to buy the cheapest thing possible for the job I need to do and use it until it breaks, wears out, or otherwise fails before replacing it with a more expensive version. The idea is that I'll have no idea how much use I will get out of a tool so this way, if I end up using a tool just once or twice or year then I haven't wasted any money on expensive tools that I barely use and if I've used a tool so much that I have broken it or worn it out, then I have a good excuse to buy a more expensive tool and will have a much better idea of what to look out for when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a compilation of some tools I've broken recently and my plans for their replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rolson Quality Tools Screwdriver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they have to write "quality" on the product, you just know that's exactly what it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this screwdriver I was removing some fitted cupboardry from my porch that was attached to the stone floor with, it turns out, 120mm &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtainium"&gt;unobtainium&lt;/a&gt; wood screws -- I'm honestly surprised that the handle gave up before stripping the screw head. The handle appears to be made entirely of some kind of rubber polymer and just sheared off the driver shaft in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A &amp;quot;Quality&amp;quot; Screwdriver" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/07-broken_screwdriver_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have no special requirements for screwdrivers and this Rolson already lasted for years, I just replaced it with another budget brand driver from the big, orange DIY retailer. This one however appears to have a PA6 Nylon handle (with some rubber overmolding for comfort) so hopefully it holds up better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacAllister Clamp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it looks like I squeezed the handle off this clamp, I can't take all the credit for breaking this -- it was mostly a bit of plywood. I was moving a full sheet of 18mm plywood and didn't see that this clamp was on the floor when I set it down, but I did hear the tell-tale crack of snapping plastic. MacAllister is the power tool own-brand from the big, orange DIY retailer, so I don't expect the greatest quality, but I didn't expect the handles to just snap off when subjected to a bit of side-load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Squeeze Too Far" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/07-broken_clamp_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this clamp came in a set from the reduced bin, and you can't have too many clamps, I have a bunch of them knocking about so I haven't needed to buy any replacements yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This Anonymous Clawhammer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had this old clawhammer for so long I don't remember where it came from originally, but it has been a faithful servant for years until one day when I was (ab)using the claw and exerted what was obviously too much force and the handle finally gave up and snapped in two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Final Blow" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/07-broken_hammer_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this hammer, so instead of buying a replacement, I will be making a new handle from a nice piece of slow-grown hardwood and repairing it. &lt;a href="/11-simple-hammer-repair.html"&gt;A future blog post&lt;/a&gt; will detail this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MacAllister Miniature Bench Vice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought a couple of these cheap, miniature bench vices for work-holding in the sewing room. Unfortunately the plastic knobs on the handles came pre-cracked from the factory and fell off as soon as the vice was out of the box. This means that they are, unsurprisingly, quite difficult to use due to the handle bar falling onto the floor and rolling under the bench whenever you turn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Bad Habit" src="https://matbooth.co.uk/images/diy/07-broken_vice_hand_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there seems to be nothing wrong with the vices themselves (qualified with a "yet," since they are still brand new) I'll be making some new vice handles in a future blog post so that we can give them a fair try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"></category><category term="diy"></category></entry></feed>
