Summary: Current status of Eclipse in Fedora.

Eclipse Mars will be landing in Fedora 22 repositories very soon! The update is currently in testing and you can help test it by installing it from the "updates-testing" repository:

    :::console
    $ sudo dnf --enablerepo=updates-testing update eclipse\*

And if you have time, please [leave feedback](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-11679/) (positive or negative) by [adding a comment](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2015-11679/) in Bodhi, the Fedora updates system.

Early adopters will probably know that Eclipse Mars is already available in the [Fedora 23 Alpha](https://getfedora.org/en_GB/workstation/prerelease/) that was released on Tuesday, which you can try if you are feeling brave; any bugs will be gratefully recieved. It is very probable that by the time Fedora 23 is released around Hallowe'en, it will be shipping with Eclipse Mars SR1.
