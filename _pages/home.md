# IDE Tools

![Screenshot of the Eclipse IDE](/assets/images/home_ide.jpg){: .service_image}

Good tooling is essential for make software engineers efficient at their jobs. Properly integrated tooling is even better. Adding IDE support for your domain specific language, framework or tools and debuggers can greatly improve the development workflow for your engineers and your customer's engineers.

Get users up and running quickly by adding simplified project creation wizards; make it easier to debug and run projects by adding customised debugger and external tool support; give the IDE a deep comprehension of your projects allowing detailed code analysis and advanced refactoring. These are just some of the integrations that can be made with the development of bespoke plug-ins for the Eclipse IDE.

# RCP Applications

The Eclipse Rich Client Platform is the framework upon which the Eclipse IDE is built and while the IDE is the most well-known RCP application, it can be used to create any kind of desktop application. It's a stable and modular platform that is used for anything from rapid prototyping to the architecture of large, cross-platform, interactive business applications.

RCP in turn is built on the Equinox OSGi framework, which is a modular, service-oriented framework with a dynamic component model that can be run in any environent that Java runs. OSGi frameworks frequently run applications in diverse environments from small embedded systems to large application servers.

# Open Source

![Screenshot of a pull request](/assets/images/home_foss.jpg){: .service_image}

Open source is the cornerstone of all modern software projects. Not only can you benefit also from bug-fixes and enhancements made by the wider community but you can also sponsor the development of open source projects on which you depend and help guide their development to meet your specific use-cases.

Reduce your maintenance costs and improve the long term sustainability of your products by getting bugs fixed and enhancements merged upstream so that you don't have to maintain your own complex patchsets and downstream forks.
